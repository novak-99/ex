Cpplex â€” making complex analysis simple! 
===================================

Complex analysis in C++ is slow, lackluster, and boring. 

Cpplex makes operations with complex numbers a lot faster, and also adds much more functionality! 

Regardless of whether you need tools for scientific computing, signal processing, or numerical analysis, cpplex is the right library for you!
