Cpplex â€” making complex analysis simple! 
===================================

Complex analysis in C++ is slow and lacks a lot of features.

Cpplex makes operations with complex numbers a lot faster and adds much more functionality!

Whether you need tools for scientific computing, signal processing, or numerical analysis, cpplex is the right library for you!
